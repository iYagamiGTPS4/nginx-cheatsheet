# Advanced Nginx Topics

Enterprise-level Nginx configurations for large-scale deployments and high-traffic applications.

## Prerequisites

- Solid understanding of basic Nginx concepts
- Experience with production deployments
- Knowledge of load balancing and caching concepts
- Familiarity with monitoring and security practices

## Advanced Topics

### Infrastructure & Scaling
- **[Load Balancing](LOAD-BALANCING.md)** - Advanced load balancing algorithms, health checks, and session persistence
- **[High Availability](HIGH-AVAILABILITY.md)** - Multi-master setups, failover, and active-passive configurations
- **[Performance](PERFORMANCE.md)** - HTTP/2/3 optimization, connection pooling, and zero-downtime deployments

### Caching & Content Delivery
- **[Caching Strategies](CACHING-STRATEGIES.md)** - Advanced caching configurations, purging, and microcaching
- **[Streaming](STREAMING.md)** - RTMP, HLS/DASH, live streaming, and VOD configurations

### Security & Monitoring
- **[Security](SECURITY.md)** - WAF integration, advanced rate limiting, bot detection, and DDoS mitigation
- **[Monitoring](MONITORING.md)** - Prometheus integration, custom metrics, and log aggregation

### Modern Architectures
- **[Microservices](MICROSERVICES.md)** - Service mesh integration, API gateway patterns, and circuit breakers
- **[Kubernetes](KUBERNETES.md)** - Nginx Ingress Controller, ConfigMaps, and traffic splitting

## When to Use Advanced Features

### Load Balancing
- Multiple backend servers
- High availability requirements
- Session persistence needs
- Geographic distribution

### Caching
- High-traffic applications
- Expensive backend operations
- CDN-like functionality
- API response caching

### Security
- Public-facing applications
- High-value targets
- Compliance requirements
- Bot traffic management

### Performance
- High-concurrency applications
- Low-latency requirements
- Resource optimization
- Cost reduction

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic configurations and add complexity gradually
2. **Monitor Everything**: Implement comprehensive monitoring before scaling
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Load test all configurations before production
4. **Document Changes**: Keep detailed records of configuration changes
5. **Plan for Failure**: Design for resilience and graceful degradation

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-optimizing too early
- Ignoring security implications
- Not planning for monitoring
- Underestimating complexity
- Poor documentation
